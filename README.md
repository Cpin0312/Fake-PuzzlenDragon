Hey,Nice to meet your.
I am just a beginner of Js,and also to fan for Puzzle and Dragons(※PAD).I try my best to write to

# Game
This game is function LIKE [Puzzle and Dragon](http://www.gunghoonline.com/games/puzzle-dragons/)

Your are able to drag a drop move over map.

# Rule
That is very Easy You just Need to make 10combos in 8 seconds.

if you cant do it in 5 times, game is over.

when you win the game, the monster would be eggs and show.

# Some issue for me
I wish to use TweenJs to control sprite, is TweenJs position to share stage with PIXI?
When matched drops was remove, your can hear the effect sound, but very low volume(because i am get it from youtube, and use (GoldWare)[https://www.goldwave.com/] to modified it.)

i need some way to mave a effect able to increase a frequency(Hz), SoundJs look like not support it, can some one tell me how to make it?

example like

1 combo = play sound with 10Hz

2 combo = play sound with 12Hz

3 combo = play sound with 14Hz and etc
 
# Improvement
i am trying to use TweenJs to move monster or egg , but maybe i need more times.... 

if your have feel some bugs or any comments, please tell me, i try to make this game be more complete.

# Thanks for your are reading until here.

This is my first game, if your have feel some bad thing for me, i would try to improve it.

Thank.
